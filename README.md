Perl 6 Design Documents
=======================

This repository contains the Perl 6 design documents, also called "Synopses",
in Pod (5 and 6) format. A [regularly updated HTML
version](http://design.perl6.org/) is available.

Historically, these documents have determined the direction of Perl 6. As
implementations matured, this role shifted (and still shifts) towards
documenting the experience from the implementations.

Instead the [test suite](https://github.com/perl6/roast/) is becoming the
specification, and the "specs" in the repository name of the design documents
tends to mean "speculations" now.
