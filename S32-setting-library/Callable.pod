DRAFT: Synopsis 32: Setting Library - Callable

=head1 VERSION

The document is a draft.

This document documents Code, Block, Signature, Capture, Routine, Sub, Method, Submethod,
and Macro.

=head1 Callable

    role Callable {...}

The C<Callable> role implies the ability
to support C<< postcircumfix:<( )> >>.

=head1 Code

    class Code does Callable {...}

Base class for all executable objects.

=over

=item signature

 method signature( --> Signature )

=item assuming

 method assuming( Code $executable: *@curried_positionals, *%curried_named --> Code)

C<assuming> primes C<$executable>, returning a C<Code> object that,
when executed, will use curried arguments as well as any additionally
supplied arguments. See L<S06/Priming>.

=item defined

 method defined( --> Bool )

For C<Code>, the C<.defined> method returns whether a body has
been defined.  A body consisting only of C<...>, C<!!!>, or C<???>
(with optional message arguments) does not count as defined.

To test if a name has been declared, look up the symbol in the
appropriate symbol table.

=head1 Block

    # Executable objects that have lexical scopes
    class Block is Code does Callable {
        method next()   {...}
        method last()   {...}
        method redo()   {...}
        method leave()  {...}
        method labels() {...}
        method as()     {...} # See L<S12/Introspection> and L<S02/Value types>
    }

=head1 Signature

 class Signature {...}

The C<Signature> class is used for function parameters, as the left-hand
side of a binding, and for the argument to declarators like C<my>.
See L<S02/Signature objects>, L<S06/Signatures>, and L<S06/Signature Introspection>

=head1 Capture

 class Capture does Positional does Associative {...}

The C<Capture> class is used for the arguments of function calls
and the right-hand side of a binding.
See L<S02/Lists, parameters, and Captures>

=head1 WrapHandle

 class WrapHandle {...}

=head1 Routine

 class Routine is Block {
      method wrap(Code $code --> WrapHandle ) {...}
      method unwrap(Wraphandle $original --> Routine ) {...}
      method name( --> Str ) {...}
      method multi( --> Bool ) {...}
 }

=over

=item unwrap

See L<S06/Wrapping>.

=item wrap

 method wrap(Code $code) {...}

See L<S06/Wrapping>.

=back

=head1 Sub

    class Sub is Routine {...}

=head1 Method

    class Method is Routine {...}

=head1 Submethod

    class Submethod is Routine {...}

=head1 Macro

    class Macro is Routine {...}
