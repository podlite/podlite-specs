=head1 VERSION

    Created: 26 June 2013

    Last Modified: 18 Aug 2014
    Version: 7

This document tries to define many of the terms used within the Perl 6
community.  It does not have an Apocalypse or Exegesis predecessor.  It
is intended as both a quick introduction to terms used on the #perl6
channel (on freenode), as well as a more permanent, and deeper source of
explanations in the context of Perl 6.

If you, as a reader, miss a term in a glossary, just add the term with the
explanation.  Or if you are not sure what the missing term means, just add a
header for the term.  Without doubt, someone else more knowledgable will add
the explanation later for you and everybody else.

=head1 A

=head2 ack

An improved version of L</grep>, written in Perl (L<http://beyondgrep.com>).

Also used by old folks to indicated acknowledgement.

=head2 actions

A class used to generate an L</AST> from the results of parsing text with a
L</grammar>.

=head2 adverb

See L<adverbial pair>.

=head2 adverbial pair

A generalized form of L</pair notation>.  They all start with the colon, like:

  adverbial pair  | pair notation
  ================|==============
  :foo<bar>       | foo => 'bar'
  :foo(bar)       | foo => bar
  :$foo           | foo => $foo
  :foo            | foo => True
  :!foo           | foo => False

=head2 AFAICS

As Far As I Can See.

=head2 AFAICT

As Far As I Can Tell.

=head2 AFAIK

As Far As I Know.

=head2 afk

Away From Keyboard.  Logged in, but there's noone looking at the screen.

=head2 ALAP

As Late As Possible

=head2 Any

The class from which most things derive, except for L</Junction>s.

=head2 any()

A Junction with "or" semantics.

=head2 API

Application Programming Interface. Ideally, someone using your system or
library should be able to do so with knowledge only of the API, but not
necessarily knowing anything about the internals or implementation.

=head2 Apocalypse

A document originally written by L</TimToady>, in which he processed the
initial barrage of RFC's that came out of the Perl community.  Now only kept
as an historical document for reference.  See also L</Exegesis> and
L</Synopsis>.

=head2 Arity

Number of L</operands> expected by an L</operator>.

=head2 array

=head2 AST

Short for B<A>bstract B<S>yntax B<T>ree. Used in many places, including
L</actions>, L</PAST>, and L</QAST>.

=head2 atomic

See L</CAS>.

=head2 attribute

Per-object storage slot. Other languages call it "Field", "Member", "Slot" or
"Property".

=head2 auth

Way of deliberately ambiguously expressing L</author> or L</authority>.

=head2 author

=head2 authority

=head2 autopun

"Are you ignorant or apathetic?" - "I don't know, and I don't care."

=head1 B

=head2 backlog

That part of a discussion on an L</IRC> channel that you've missed.  If it is
not or no longer available in your IRC client, you can go to sites such as
L<http://irc.perl6.org> to see what has been logged for you.

=head2 backtrack

=head2 backend

=head2 Bailador

Spanish for "dancer", The Bailador module (L<https://github.com/tadzik/Bailador/>)
is a port of Perl 5's Dancer web framework (L<http://perldancer.org/>).

=head2 biab

Back In A Bit.  Only L</afk> for a little while.

=head2 binary

An operator is binary or of L</arity> two if its L</category> is L</infix> or L</postcircumfix>.

=head2 blast

"B<Bl>ock, B<A>lternatively B<St>atement". Several constructs in Perl 6 expect
either a single L</statement>, or a L</block>. Thus, a blast:

    try { dangerous(); functions() };
    #   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Block
    try dangerous-function();
    #   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^          Statement

Particularly cute, because L</phaser>s expect blasts.

=head2 block

A source code section delimited by braces.
Used for L<control flow> and as L</scope>.

=head2 Bool

L</Boolean> type.

=head2 boolean

L</Value> of type L</Bool>. Apart the class itself, can be either <True> or <False>.

=head2 boolean context

A L</context> that forces an L</expression> to give a L</boolean> value.
The L</prefix> L</operators> C<so>, C<not> and their
repective higher L</precedence> C<?> and <!> forms force a boolean context.
The L</predicate> part of a L</control flow> L</statement> forces a boolean context.
A class can define a C<Bool> method to handle the boolean context.
For L</native>s, within L</MoarVM>, it is handled by L</MVMBoolificationSpec> member
of the L</stable> structure.

=head2 bootstrap

Starting up a system that uses itself to define, build or compile itself, is a practical exercise on solving the chicken and egg problem.
This phase is called bootstrap. L<Documentation|https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/docs/bootstrap.markdown>
about booststrapping the L</6model> of L<MoarVM>

=head2 boxing

Operation transforming a L</native> L</value> into an object.
The reverse operation is unboxing.
The relation between boxed/native should not be confused
with L</container>/containee.

=head2 branch

=head2 brb

Be Right Back.  Only L</afk> for a little while.

=head2 BS

Bounded Serialization.

=head1 C

=head2 caller

The piece of code (or its lexical environment) that called a given piece of
code. Generally only known at run time.

=head2 CALLER::

A pseudo scope to access variables from the caller's scope.

=head2 Camelia

The butterfly-like logo of Perl 6 as can be observed at L<http://perl6.org>.

=head2 camelia

The IRC-bot on #perl6 that will evaluate code for you in various version of
Perl 5, Perl 6 and NQP.

=head2 capture

A regex can record text that are matched by a certain part of the regex. That
part (and the matched text) is a capture.

For example

    if '..42' ~~ / \.+ (\d+) / {
        #              ^^^^^ capture
        say $0;
        #   ^^ capture variable
    }

=head2 CAS

An atomic Compare And Swap.  Primitive for lock-free multi-threaded read/write
access.

=head2 Category

See L</operator>.

=head2 CFG

1) Context Free Grammar.
2) see L</Control Flow Graph>.

=head2 circularity saw

A pun on "circular saw".  When bootstrapping a language in terms
of itself, we must rely on circular definitions in various places.
Obviously if we were really to use those circular definitions to
implement our language, we'll just get stuck in an infinite regress.
So instead we grab our trusty "circularity saw" to cut those circular
definitions in a spot deep down, hopefully in a way that the resulting
splice will be very difficult for the end-user to notice in day-to-day use.

=head2 circumfix

If a syntactic construct, for example a pair of parenthesis, surrounds another
piece of syntax, the surrounding first part is called a circumfix.

    say (2 + 3);
      # ^^^^^^^ circumfix
    say <a b c>;
      # ^^^^^^^ circumfix

=head2 class

See L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28computer_programming%29>.

=head2 CLI

Command Line Interface, what you see in a Terminal (window).

=head2 clog

To L</backlog>.

Etymology: There is a website C<irclog.perlgeek.de> providing either IRC logs
or IR clogs, depending on how you interpret the domain name.

=head2 CLR

Common Language Runtime, as used by Niecza/mono/.NET.

=head2 comment

Parts of a program intend for user consumption that are not used to generate code.
Beside the C<#> that starts a comment that ends with the current line
Perl 6 supports many syntactic forms for different kinds of comments.
Like inline comments that can be used as L</whitespace>, or comments
that appear after a name declaration that are included in the </pod>
documentation.

=head2 compilation unit

A L</compilation unit> is a set of files or a string that is compiled at once.
It involves the L</serialization> of code and data.

=head2 compile time

=head2 compiler

In a L</dynamic language> like Perl 6, the compiler is also referred as L</interpreter>.
In simpler dynamic languages like
Perl 5, the interpreter does not go through conceptual phases similar to the one for a compiler
of non dynamic language, the term compiler is rarely used.

When transforming L</concrete> to L</bytecode>, the first conceptual phase is called L<parsing|/parse>
and generate a L</parse tree>. Next the parse tree is transformed into an abstract syntax tree which is a form
that can be optimised. Next the abstract tree is transformed to L</bytecode> in an L</compilation unit>.
Then, this bytecode is executed. Depending on the type of the data manipulated by the L</program>
bytecode can be transformed in optimised bytecode or into L</machine code>.
This last two operations are forms of L</JIT>.

=head2 composer

A composer is a syntax for defining L</values>. When values are L</object>s, their composer is a L</Huffmanization>
of a L</constructor> L</expression>.

=head2 compunit

See L</compilation unit>.

=head2 concurrency

=head2 concrete syntax

=head2 container

=head2 context

=head2 control flow

Without control flow statements, a program execution would be purely sequential.
Control flow statement generally uses a predicate and branches to one of its
subtatement according to the predicate value.

=head2 Control Flow Graph

in L</spesh>, a L</dominance> graph generated from L</bytecode> analysis so that L</Single Static Assignment>
can be done.

=head2 constant

A L</variable> that has a unchangeable value.

=head2 constructor

The OO way to I<construct> object. L<Composer>s are constructor L</Huffmanization>s that are available for
the most common types like L</pairs>s

=head2 CPAN

Comprehensive Perl Archive Network.  Content delivery system for Perl
distributions.

=head2 credentials

=head2 CUR

Short for C<CompUnitRepo>, the type of objects that inhabit C<@*INC>.

=head2 CURL

Short for C<CompUnitRepo::Local>, the type of C<CompUnitRepo> objects that
refer to the local file system.

=head1 D

=head2 dalek

An L</IRC> bot that reports when various projects have been updated. It gives
L</karma> to those who pushed the changes to the project.

=head2 DarkPAN

Perl code in production use at companies that has never been uploaded to CPAN.
As in "how will this change affect the DarkPAN", which can't be answered
because you generally don't have access to that code.

=head2 dead code

Code that is never called. For example

    sub f() {
        say 42;
        return;
        # everything below this is dead code,
        # because the return; above prevents it from running
        say 23;
    }

=head2 debugger

A piece of software that helps you to track down errors in your software.
It typically allows things like stepping through code, setting breakpoints
and inspecting variables.

=head2 dev

Either a developer (person), or a development version of a program, or a
branch for development in a repository.

=head2 DFS

Depth First Search. See L<also|http://xkcd.com/761/>.

=head2 dies_ok

A C<Test> function that succeeds when its argument, a Code object, dies at run
time. See L<S24|http://perlcabal.org/syn/S24.html>.

=head2 diffy

An L</operator> that produces a resulting L</value> of a L</type> different from its L</argument>s. For
example, all the comparison operators like C<==> and C<lt> are diffy (because
they produce C<Bool>s), the range operators are diffy (because they produce
ranges), but C<+> and C<~> and C<x> are not diffy because they (sorta, kinda)
emit what they accept.

The reason we care about operators being diffy or not is that you can basically
only reduce on non-diffy stuff. So C<[+]> makes sense, but C<[..]> doesn't.
(C<[==]> actually does makes sense even though it's diffy, but that's because
it's also chaining.) You also can't make assignment metaoperators from diffy
operators. So C<+=> makes sense, but C<..=> doesn't.

=head2 DIHWIDT

"Doctor, It Hurts When I Do This."  Well, stop doing it then.

=head2 dispatcher

The piece of code in the runtime that determines which (multi) method or
subroutine to invoke.

=head2 distribution

A collection of 1 or more L</compunit>s for installing locally, or for loading
from a remote location.

=head2 DSL

L</Domain Specific Language>. See L</slang>.

=head2 Domain specific language.

=head2 Dominance

See </Control Flow Graph>

=head2 dynamic

=head2 dynamic language

=head1 E

=head2 eager

One of the opposites of L</lazy>.

=head2 ecosystem

by L</Panda>. L</Rakudo *> include a tested subset of the ecosystem.

=head2 edsel

Something that intends to please everyone by catering for everybody's taste,
yet in the end pleasing nobody, because nobody is catered for enough.

=head2 EPIC FAIL

=head2 EVAL

=head2 Exegesis

A document originally written by L</TheDamian>, in which he tried to explain
the L</Apocalypse>s to the common (wo)man.  Now only kept as an historical
document for reference.  See also L</Synopsis>.

=head2 export

See </import>.

=head2 EXPORT::

=head2 Expression

An expression is a part of a statement that is constituted of operators and their operands
and gives a value. The semantic of an expression may depend on its L</context>.
An expression is all or part of a L</statement>.

=head2 Extop

An extension to the default L</bytecode> L</instruction set> in L</Parrot> or L</MoarVM>.

=head1 F

=head2 FAIL

=head2 fiddly

Used of an L</operator> that doesn't participate in forming metaoperators at all.
(Because that would be "too fiddly" to get to work, presumably.) C<?? !!> is
such an operator. The method call operator is another. (And hence C<.=> is
actually a special case, not a "real" metaoperator.) List assignment is also
fiddly. (But item assignment is not.)

No meta in fiddly things. So you can't reduce, negate, reverse, sequence,
cross, zip, hyperify or assignify fiddly operators.

=head2 FIFO

First In First Out

=head2 flap

Sometimes a test will fail under some conditions, but not others; when
this test passes some test runs and fails others, it's called flapping.

=head2 fork

The creation of another process.

Also, a feature of L</github> that copies a repository from one user to another,
to allow users to make changes to a repository without needing permissions on
the original project. After a user makes changes they will likely submit a
L</pull request>.

=head2 fossil

Something in a generally current document that is no longer true but which has
not yet been fixed by correcting or removing it.

=head2 FSVO

For Some Value Of.

=head2 FTFY

Fixed That For You.

=head2 fudge

Way to temporarily mark tests in the L</spectest> for a specific Perl 6 version
as I<todo> (so that a failure of the test will be marked ok, and a pass will
be marked as an exception), or as I<skip> if they cause a L</compile-time> or
L</runtime> exception.

=head1 G

=head2 GC

Garbage collecting.

=head2 gimme

=head2 gist

A summary, or a method on objects that is invoked by L</say> to print out the
object in a human readable format, or a paste server used by denizens of L</IRC>.

The C<ecosystem> is hosted on github.

=head2 GLOBAL::

=head2 golf

Shortest possible way (least amount of typed characters) to get a program to do
what you want, or to describe a problem or bug.

In the case of bug hunting, the aim is only partly "fewest characters" and
partly "fewest concepts". The aim being to show exactly what concepts are
necessary to trigger the surprising behavior.

=head2 golfing

The process of creating the shortest possible program to prove what you want.
Sometimes also a form of L</obfuscation>.

=head2 good *

Good morning/afternoon/evening.  Since the contributors are in many different
timezones, one contributor's morning is another contributor's evening.

=head2 grammar

A feature of Perl 6 that uses L</regex>es to implement a grammar for parsing
text. Perl 6 implementations use grammars themselves to parse the language. The
results of parsing with a grammar can be further passed on to L</actions>.
A grammar is composed of methods introduced by one of the three keywords
C<rule>, C<L</token>>, C<regex>. There is L</backtrack>ing only in C<regex> and
C<rule> implies L</whitespace>s between subrules.

=head2 green threads

Threads that are scheduled by the virtual machine, not by the operating
system.

=head1 H

=head2 hash

A data type, conveniently available in variables starting with the percent sign
C<%> and provided by types conformant to the C<Associative> role like the C<Hash> type.
Often called associative table in other languages.

=head2 High Level Language

A high level language provides abstractions that decouples it from specific operating systems
and processors. Perl 6 is such a language and provides some interoperability with other HLLs when they are
compiled with the rakudo toolkit.
Some of these abstractions like arrays, associative tables, integers, floats, strings and objects are common
to many languages but specific semantic and underlying type L</representation>s may differ.
Also, a given language may provide many flavors of them.
Perl 6 provides common L</concrete syntax> to access them.
C<MVMHLLConfig> is the L</MoarVM> C level structure that hooks
to the underlying language specific representations.
The L</metamodel> allows to express specific semantics proper to a given L</OO> language.
L</Zavolaj> provides interoperabiity with languages which compilers
follow C language linking conventions.

=head2 HLL

See L</High Level Language>.

=head2 HN

Hacker news as seen on L<https://news.ycombinator.com>.

=head2 HN'ed

fanfic with far more significance than the word "fanfic" might lead you to
believe. See L<http://hpmor.com>.

=head2 Huffmanization

L<Huffman coding|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding> is a compression algorithm that encodes
common symbols with a short code. By analogy, we call huffmanization alternative and shorter syntax
for common syntax constructs. The cost of huffmanization is the cost of learning additional syntax.
In Perl 6, L</composer>s are a form of huffmanization.

=head2 hyper

Process data asynchronously when possible, but return the result data in the
order it would have been if the source data had been processed in a single
thread/process.

=head2 hypothetical variable

=head1 I

=head2 IC

I see.

=head2 iffy

Used of an operator that either returns a C<Bool> result, I<or something like
it> (such as a match object). All the comparison operators are iffy, as are
conditional operators like C<&&>, C<?^>, and C<or>. C<%%> is iffy, but C<%>
isn't. The junctive operators are iffy.

The reason that we care about iffy operators is that you can only append the
C<!> metaoperator to an operator that's iffy.

=head2 IIRC

If I Remember Correctly.

=head2 IIUC

If I Understand Correctly.

=head2 import

L</Module>s interact with each other through named entities called symbols.
The operation that makes symbols from a module avalaible to another
module is called import while the operation of using such a name is called import.

=head2 infix

An operator that can appear between two terms.

=head2 inline

=head2 install

=head2 installer

=head2 Int

A built-in arbitrary-sized integer type. See L<http://doc.perl6.org/type/Int>.

the L</source code> to generate L</object code> or L</bytecode>.
In L</rakudo> : L</parse tree>, and L<Abstract Syntax Tree>.
The L</parser> generates a  that is transformeed to an </AST>s
Sometimes the information can be regenerated from the bytecode.
In rakudo the Single Static Assignment form is inferred from the bytecode.

not from any information from run time.

=head2 lexical pad

A data structure that holds the values of lexical variables.

=head2 lexotic

A dynamic operation with a lexically scoped target. For example, C<return> has
a dynamic effect (it peels back the call stack), but the thing it's returning
from is a lexically defined routine.

=head2 LHF

Low Hanging Fruit.

=head2 Library

The compilation of a L</compilation unit> of source code written in non dynamic language like C
results in a library.

=head2 LIFO

=head2 namespace

=head2 Native Call

=head2 Native value

A native value is a L</int>, L</num>, L</str>.
A native value cannot be undefined.

=head2 name

=head2 Niecza

An implementation of Perl 6 targeting the .NET platform.

=head2 NST

implementing L</Rakudo>. Targets L</Parrot> and the L</JVM>, with work underway
on targeting L</MoarVM>.

=head1 O

=head2 Obfuscation

Code deliberately unreadable often using esoteric language features.
Sometimes combined with L</Golfing>.

=head2 Object code

For non L</dynamic languages>, from a L</compilation unit>, the L</compiler> generates
object code or library. A latter phase links object code to generate an executable.
For dynamic languages like Perl 6, the equivalent of object code is the L</bytecode> and
the linking phase is more complex and involves the deL</serialization> of information.

=head2 On Stack Replacement

According to the hotspot L</glossary|http://openjdk.java.net/groups/hotspot/docs/HotSpotGlossary.html> :  The process of converting
an interpreted (or less optimized) stack frame into a compiled (or more optimized) stack frame.

=head2 our

=head2 OO

Object oriented

=head2 Opcode

An opcode is an instruction in a bytecode.
Documentation about L</MoarVM> L<opcodes|https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/blob/master/docs/bytecode.markdown>.

=head2 open source

=head2 operand

See L</operator>.

=head2 operator

An expression is made of operators and operands. More precisely it is made of an operator and
operands that can be subexpressions or L</values>.
Operators are an alternative syntax for a L<multi method>. With that syntax, what would be the L</argument>s of the function
are named operands instead. Operators are classified into L<categories|http://perlcabal.org/syn/S02.html#Grammatical_Categories> of categories.
A category has a precedence, an arity, can be L</fidly>, L</iffy>, L</diffy>.
Perl 6 is very creative as to what is an operator so they are many categories which operators are amde
of many tokens, possibly with a subexpression.  For example,  L<@a[0]> belongs to the
postcircumfix category is broken in the operand C<@a> and the
postcircumfix operator L<[0]> where C<0> is postcircumfixed subexpression.

The C<< <O(I<...>)>  >> construction gives information about an operator that completes the
information provided by its category.
Below C<%conditional> is the category, C<< :reducecheck<ternary> >> specifies to call C<.ternary> to
