=head1 VERSION

    Created: 26 June 2013

    Last Modified: 15 Aug 2014
    Version: 6

This document tries to define many of the terms used within the Perl 6
community.  It does not have an Apocalypse or Exegesis predecessor.  It
is intended as both a quick introduction to terms used on the #perl6
channel (on freenode), as well as a more permanent, and deeper source of
explanations in the context of Perl 6.

If you, as a reader, miss a term in a glossary, just add the term with the
explanation.  Or if you are not sure what the missing term means, just add a
header for the term.  Without doubt, someone else more knowledgable will add
the explanation later for you and everybody else.

=head1 A

=head2 ack

An improved version of L</grep>, written in Perl (L<http://beyondgrep.com>).

Also used by old folks to indicated acknowledgement.

=head2 actions

A class used to generate an L</AST> from the results of parsing text with a
L</grammar>.

=head2 adverb

See L<adverbial pair>.

=head2 adverbial pair

A generalized form of L</pair notation>.  They all start with the colon, like:

  adverbial pair  | pair notation
  ================|==============
  :foo<bar>       | foo => 'bar'
  :foo(bar)       | foo => bar
  :$foo           | foo => $foo
  :foo            | foo => True
  :!foo           | foo => False

=head2 AFAICS

As Far As I Can See.

=head2 AFAICT

As Far As I Can Tell.

=head2 AFAIK

As Far As I Know.

=head2 afk

Away From Keyboard.  Logged in, but there's noone looking at the screen.

=head2 Any

The class from which most things derive, except for L</Junction>s.

=head2 any()

A Junction with "or" semantics.

=head2 API

Application Programming Interface. Ideally, someone using your system or
library should be able to do so with knowledge only of the API, but not
necessarily knowing anything about the internals or implementation.

=head2 Apocalypse

A document originally written by L</TimToady>, in which he processed the
initial barrage of RFC's that came out of the Perl community.  Now only kept
as an historical document for reference.  See also L</Exegesis> and
L</Synopsis>.

=head2 Arity

Number of L</operands> expected by an L</operator>

=head2 array

=head2 AST

Short for B<A>bstract B<S>yntax B<T>ree. Used in many places, including
L</actions>, L</PAST>, and L</QAST>.

=head2 attribute

Per-object storage slot. Other languages call it "Field", "Member", "Slot" or
"Property".

=head2 auth

Way of deliberately ambiguously expressing L</author> or L</authority>.

=head2 author

=head2 authority

=head2 autopun

"Are you ignorant or apathetic?" - "I don't know, and I don't care."

=head1 B

=head2 backlog

That part of a discussion on an L</IRC> channel that you've missed.  If it is
not or no longer available in your IRC client, you can go to sites such as
L<http://irc.perl6.org> to see what has been logged for you.

=head2 backtrack

=head2 Bailador

Spanish for "dancer", The Bailador module (L<https://github.com/tadzik/Bailador/>)
is a port of Perl 5's Dancer web framework (L<http://perldancer.org/>).

=head2 biab

Back In A Bit.  Only L</afk> for a little while.

=head2 binary

An operator is binary or of L</arity> two if its L</category> is L</infix> or </postcircumfix>

=head2 blast

"B<Bl>ock, B<A>lternatively B<St>atement". Several constructs in Perl 6 expect
either a single statement, or a block. Thus, a blast:

    try { dangerous(); functions() };
    #   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Block
    try dangerous-function();
    #   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^          Statement

Particularly cute, because L</phaser>s expect blasts.

=head2 boxing



=head2 brb

Be Right Back.  Only L</afk> for a little while.

=head2 BS

Bounded Serialization.

=head1 C

=head2 caller

The piece of code (or its lexical environment) that called a given piece of
code. Generally only known at run time.

=head2 CALLER::

A pseudo scope to access variables from the caller's scope.

=head2 Camelia

The butterfly-like logo of Perl 6 as can be observed at L<http://perl6.org>.

=head2 camelia

The IRC-bot on #perl6 that will evaluate code for you in various version of
Perl 5, Perl 6 and NQP.

=head2 capture

A regex can record text that are matched by a certain part of the regex. That
part (and the matched text) is a capture.

For example

    if '..42' ~~ / \.+ (\d+) / {
        #              ^^^^^ capture
        say $0;
        #   ^^ capture variable
    }

=head2 CAS

An atomic Compare And Swap.  Primitive for lock-free multi-threaded read/write
access.

=head2 Category

See L</operator>

=head2 circularity saw

A pun on "circular saw".  When bootstrapping a language in terms
of itself, we must rely on circular definitions in various places.
Obviously if we were really to use those circular definitions to
implement our language, we'll just get stuck in an infinite regress.
So instead we grab our trusty "circularity saw" to cut those circular
definitions in a spot deep down, hopefully in a way that the resulting
splice will be very difficult for the end-user to notice in day-to-day use.

=head2 circumfix

If a syntactic construct, for example a pair of parenthesis, surrounds another
piece of syntax, the surrounding first part is called a circumfix.

    say (2 + 3);
      # ^^^^^^^ circumfix
    say <a b c>;
      # ^^^^^^^ circumfix

=head2 class

See L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28computer_programming%29>

=head2 CLI

Command Line Interface, what you see in a Terminal (window).

=head2 clog

To L</backlog>.

Etymology: There is a website C<irclog.perlgeek.de> providing either IRC logs
or IR clogs, depending on how you interpret the domain name.

=head2 CLR

Common Language Runtime, as used by Niecza/mono/.NET.

=head2 compilation unit

A L</compilation unit is a set of files or a string that is compiled at once.
It involves the L</serialization> of code and data

=head2 compile time

=head2 compiler

In a L</dynamic language> like Perl 6, the compiler is also referred as L</interprete>r. 
In simpler dynamic languages like
Perl 5, the interpreter does not go thru conceptual phases similar to the one for a compiler
of non dynamic language, the term compiler is rarely used.

When transforming L</concrete> to L</bytecode>, the first conceptual phase is called L<parsing|/parse>
and generate a L</parse tree>. Next the parse tree is transformed into an abstract syntax tree which is a form
that can be optimised. Next the abstract tree is transformed to L</bytecode> in an L</compilation unit>.
Then, this bytecode is executed. Depending on the type of the data manipulated by the L</program>
bytecode can be transformed in optimised bytecode or into L</machine code>.
This last two operations are forms of L</JIT>.

=head2 composer

A composer is a syntax for defining values. When values are objects, their composer is an L</huffmanization>
of a constructor expression.


=head2 compunit

See L</compilation unit>.

=head2 concurrency

=head2 concrete syntax

=head2 container

=head2 constant

A L</variable> that has a unchangeable value.

=head2 CPAN

Comprehensive Perl Archive Network.  Content delivery system for Perl
distributions.

=head2 credentials

=head2 CUR

Short for C<CompUnitRepo>, the type of objects that inhabit C<@*INC>.

=head2 CURL

Short for C<CompUnitRepo::Local>, the type of C<CompUnitRepo> objects that
refer to the local file system.

=head1 D

=head2 dalek

An L</IRC> bot that reports when various projects have been updated. It gives
L</karma> to those who pushed the changes to the project.

=head2 DarkPAN

Perl code in production use at companies that has never been uploaded to CPAN.
As in "how will this change affect the DarkPAN", which can't be answered
because you generally don't have access to that code.

=head2 dead code

Code that is never called. For example

    sub f() {
        say 42;
        return;
        # everything below this is dead code,
        # because the return; above prevents it from running
        say 23;
    }

=head2 debugger

A piece of software that helps you to track down errors in your software.
It typically allows things like stepping through code, setting breakpoints
and inspecting variables.

=head2 dev

Either a developer (person), or a development version of a program, or a
branch for development in a repository.

=head2 dies_ok

A C<Test> function that succeeds when its argument, a Code object, dies at run
time. See L<S24>.

=head2 diffy

An L</operator> that produces a resulting L</value> of a L</type> different from its L</argument>s. For
example, all the comparison operators like C<==> and C<lt> are diffy (because
they produce C<Bool>s), the range operators are diffy (because they produce
ranges), but C<+> and C<~> and C<x> are not diffy because they (sorta, kinda)
emit what they accept.

The reason we care about operators being diffy or not is that you can basically
only reduce on non-diffy stuff. So C<[+]> makes sense, but C<[..]> doesn't.
(C<[==]> actually does makes sense even though it's diffy, but that's because
it's also chaining.) You also can't make assignment metaoperators from diffy
operators. So C<+=> makes sense, but C<..=> doesn't.

=head2 DIHWIDT

"Doctor, It Hurts When I Do This."  Well, stop doing it then.

=head2 dispatcher

The piece of code in the runtime that determines which (multi) method or
subroutine to invoke.

=head2 distribution

A collection of 1 or more L</compunit>s for installing locally, or for loading
from a remote location.

=head2 dynamic

=head2 dynamic language

=head1 E

=head2 ecosystem

The L<ecosystem|https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem> is a repository of Perl 6 modules installable
by L</Panda>. L</Rakudo *> include a tested subset of the ecosystem.

=head2 edsel

Something that intends to please everyone by catering for everybody's taste,
yet in the end pleasing nobody, because nobody is catered for enough.

=head2 EPIC FAIL

=head2 EVAL

=head2 Exegesis

A document originally written by L</TheDamian>, in which he tried to explain
the L</Apocalypse>s to the common (wo)man.  Now only kept as an historical
document for reference.  See also L</Synopsis>.

=head2 export

=head2 EXPORT::
    
=head2 Expression

An expression is a part of a statement that is constituted of operators and their operands
and gives a value. The semantic of an expression may depend on its L</context>.

=head1 F

=head2 FAIL

=head2 fiddly

Used of an L</operator> that doesn't participate in forming metaoperators at all.
(Because that would be "too fiddly" to get to work, presumably.) C<?? !!> is
such an operator. The method call operator is another. (And hence C<.=> is
actually a special case, not a "real" metaoperator.) List assignment is also
fiddly. (But item assignment is not.)

No meta in fiddly things. So you can't reduce, negate, reverse, sequence,
cross, zip, hyperify or assignify fiddly operators.

=head2 flap

Sometimes a test will fail under some conditions, but not others; when
this test passes some test runs and fails others, it's called flapping.

=head2 fork

The creation of another process.

Also, a feature of L</github> that copies a repository from one user to another,
to allow users to make changes to a repository without needing permissions on
the original project. After a user makes changes they will likely submit a
L</pull request>.

=head2 fossil

Something in a generally current document that is no longer true but which has
not yet been fixed by correcting or removing it.

=head2 FSVO

For Some Value Of.

=head2 FTFY

Fixed That For You.

=head2 fudge

Way to temporarily mark tests in the L</spectest> for a specific Perl 6 version
as I<todo> (so that a failure of the test will be marked ok, and a pass will
be marked as an exception), or as I<skip> if they cause a L</compile-time> or
L</runtime> exception.

=head1 G

=head2 GC

Garbage collecting

=head2 gimme

=head2 gist

A summary, or a method on objects that is invoked by L</say> to print out the
object in a human readable format, or a paste server used by denizens of L</IRC>.

See L<https://gist.github.com> for the last usage.

=head2 git

The distributed source revision system used by many, if not all Perl 6
projects.

=head2 GLOBAL::

=head2 golf

Shortest possible way (least amount of typed characters) to get a program to do
what you want, or to describe a problem or bug.

In the case of bug hunting, the aim is only partly "fewest characters" and
partly "fewest concepts". The aim being to show exactly what concepts are
necessary to trigger the surprising behavior.

=head2 golfing

The process of creating the shortest possible program to prove what you want.
Sometimes also a form of L</obfuscation>

=head2 good *

Good morning/afternoon/evening.  Since the contributors are in many different
timezones, one contributor's morning is another contributor's evening.

=head2 grammar

A feature of Perl 6 that uses L</regex>es to implement a grammar for parsing
text. Perl 6 implementations use grammars themselves to parse the language. The
results of parsing with a grammar can be further passed on to L</actions>.
A grammar is composed of methods introduces by one of the three keyword
C<rule>, C<L</token>>, C<regex>. There is L</backtrack>ing only in C<regex> and
C<rule> implies L</whitespace>s between subrules.

=head2 green threads

Threads that are scheduled by the virtual machine, not by the operating
system.

=head1 H

=head2 hash

A data type, conveniently available in variables starting with the percent sign
C<%> and provided by type C<Hash>.

=head2 HN

=head2 HN'ed

Being mentioned on Hacker news (L<https://news.ycombinator.com>).

=head2 HPMoR

fanfic with far more significance than the word "fanfic" might lead you to
believe. See L<http://hpmor.com>.

=head2 Huffmanization

L<Huffman coding|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding is a compression algorithm that encode
common symbols with a short code. By analogy, we call huffmanization alternative and shorter syntax
for common syntax constructs. The cost of huffmanization is the cost of learning additional syntax.
In Perl 6, L</composer>s are a form of huffmanization.

=head2 hyper

Process data asynchronously when possible, but return the result data in the
order it would have been if the source data had been processed in a single
thread/process.

=head2 hypothetical variable

=head1 I

=head2 IC

I see.

=head2 iffy

Used of an operator that either returns a C<Bool> result, I<or something like
it> (such as a match object). All the comparison operators are iffy, as are
conditional operators like C<&&>, C<?^>, and C<or>. C<%%> is iffy, but C<%>
isn't. The junctive operators are iffy.

The reason that we care about iffy operators is that you can only append the
C<!> metaoperator to an operator that's iffy.

For non L</dynamic languages>, from a L</compilation unit>, the L</compiler> generates 
object code or library. A latter phase links object code to generate an executable.
For dynamic languages like Perl 6, the equivalent of object code is the L</bytecode> and
the linking phase is more complex and involves the deL</serialization> of information.

=head2 operator

An expression is constituted of operators and operands. More precisely it is made of an operator and

are named operands instead. Operators are classified into categories.
L<List|S02/Grammatical Categories> of categories.
A category has a precedence, an arity, can be L</fidly>, L</iffy>, L</diffy>

Why roast? It's the B<r>epository B<o>f B<a>ll B<s>pec B<t>ests.

=head2 role

A role  can be composed with zero or more other roles, then instanciated into
a L</class>. The L</sigil> of a variable name indicates that the defined value in the container denoted
by the variable belongs to a class  composed from the associated role.
For example, the sigil C<@> denotes the C<Positional> role. So a variable C<@a> may contain
a value of type C<List> because C<List.does(Positional)>.
